MobileDatingApp
===============

PHP code for a mobile dating app I have done. 
It includes the push notification code, everything you need to get a good start on a mobile dating app
the orginal project was for Thaijoop, not sure if they still use the code or not, but it is an exelent guide for getting distance between to lon / lat points, GCM Push and iOS Push php code.
It also returns json results.
A test page is mapps.php it contains all the service calls used in the code.
Feel free to email me if you have any questions.

It also has user location tracking, each time the device updates, it sends to the service, updatelocation and stores that data in the database. You can then pull it and see just where the users have been.

The contacts secion of the code will pull and save contacts from the device, it also can loop over them pick keys to grab phone numbers, emails etc and then you can use that data to mass email, mass sms etc.. 

Lots of useful stuff here for anyone wanting to get a dating or meeting app going. The code is seup to allow Men, Women, Ladyboy (transgender) genders.

You will need to provide the database yourself, but reading the code you should be able to figure out what tables and fields to use.

Enjoy Look for more code to come, I will be adding a few more projects here, Soon I will be adding the Swift Code to use this php back end code, great way to learn everything from tables views to xmpp chat!

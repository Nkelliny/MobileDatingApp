MobileDatingApp
===============

PHP code for a mobile dating app I have done. 
It includes the push notification code, everything you need to get a good start on a mobile dating app
the orginal project was for Thaijoop, not sure if they still use the code or not, but it is an exelent guide for getting distance 
between to lon / lat points, GCM Push and iOS Push php code.
It also returns json results.
A test page is mapps.php it contains all the service calls used in the code.
Feel free to email me if you have any questions.
